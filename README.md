## Quickstart - Overview

House Protocol is an open-source protocol built on Ethereum and Chainlink where anyone can participate and earn revenue by becoming a part of the House.  There are three  ways to earn revenue with House Protocol:

1. Contribute liquidty to an HPool, which are ERC20 backed bankrolls, and earn a proportional share of the revenue generated by that bankroll.

2. Mint your own HDealer from the HDealerFactory and connect it to a front and earn revenue from the bets placed through your HDealer contract.

3. Test your luck and take a roll against one of the bankrolls and try to beat the House

## Quickstart - Frontend

Visit the [chainlink faucet](https://kovan.chain.link/) and grab some link to pay for the oracle fees

Grab some kovan eth from the [faucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/)

```bash 

git clone https://github.com/dmintercept/house-protocol.git 

cd house-protocol 

```

>You might want to use tmux to manage the active terminal windows

```bash

yarn install

```

> you might get node-gyp errors, ignore them and run:

```bash

yarn start

```

> in a second terminal window:

```bash

yarn chain

```

This is a testing UI on Kovan

Factory Page

- Create LPs
- Create Dealers
- No token approvals required
- Use decimals of underlying token for aesthetics

LP Page 
- Approve contract as spender in the token interface below the pool
- Initialize pool to seed it with funds if you created a new pool
- Swap in an out of the pool

Game Page
- Get link from faucet
- Get Kovan Eth from a faucet
- Approve the Game as a spender of Link
- Approve the Pool you want to place bet against on the LP page as a spender of the underlying token
- Place a bet
    - Must be greater than 10000 wei
    - b is a value 10 ^ 16 and 10 ^ 10
    - b equal to 10 ^ 16 = 99% odds 1.01x payout
    - b equal to 10 ^ 20 = 1% odds and 100x payout
    - Edge is deducted from winning bets (Can be 0)
 
## Quickstart - Deploy your own

First you will need a buidler account to deploy from

```
yarn run generate

```

Once you have your deployer account you will need to get some Kovan Eth : https://faucet.kovan.network/

Once you have Kovan eth in your deployer account you are ready to deploy the contracts

Navigate to the scripts directory in the builder package:

```bash

house-protocol/buidler/scripts

```

Edit the deploy script to deploy either part or all of the protocol.

If you want your own copy of the protocol to play around with you will need to add a line in the deploy script for each of the following:

- HDealerFactory.sol
- HPoolFactory.sol
- HDealer.sol
- HPool.sol

The deploy script will compile, deploy, and publish the contract info into the react application

> in a third terminal window:

```bash

yarn deploy

```
